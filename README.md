## üìò What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software project. It is a fundamental step in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that ensures developers understand what the system should do before any coding begins.

### üîç Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

- **Clarifies Expectations**  
  It helps align the goals of the client, end-users, and the development team to avoid misunderstandings.

- **Reduces Risks**  
  Clear requirements reduce the risk of scope creep, project failure, and costly rework.

- **Improves Planning**  
  Accurate requirements help in estimating project timelines, budgets, and resource allocation.

- **Guides Design and Development**  
  It acts as a foundation for system design, architecture, and implementation.

- **Supports Testing and Validation**  
  Well-defined requirements serve as a benchmark for testing and validating the final product.

### üõ† Role in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

In the SDLC, Requirement Analysis typically follows the feasibility study and precedes system design. It helps convert vague ideas into formal, structured, and actionable items. The main outputs of this phase are:

- **Software Requirement Specification (SRS)** document  
- **User stories** or **Use cases**  
- **Functional and non-functional requirements**

Without proper requirement analysis, projects are more likely to fail due to miscommunication, delays, and poor-quality deliverables.
