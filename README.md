## üìò What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software project. It is a fundamental step in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that ensures developers understand what the system should do before any coding begins.

### üîç Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

- **Clarifies Expectations**  
  It helps align the goals of the client, end-users, and the development team to avoid misunderstandings.

- **Reduces Risks**  
  Clear requirements reduce the risk of scope creep, project failure, and costly rework.

- **Improves Planning**  
  Accurate requirements help in estimating project timelines, budgets, and resource allocation.

- **Guides Design and Development**  
  It acts as a foundation for system design, architecture, and implementation.

- **Supports Testing and Validation**  
  Well-defined requirements serve as a benchmark for testing and validating the final product.

### üõ† Role in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

In the SDLC, Requirement Analysis typically follows the feasibility study and precedes system design. It helps convert vague ideas into formal, structured, and actionable items. The main outputs of this phase are:

- **Software Requirement Specification (SRS)** document  
- **User stories** or **Use cases**  
- **Functional and non-functional requirements**

Without proper requirement analysis, projects are more likely to fail due to miscommunication, delays, and poor-quality deliverables.

## üß© Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis involves a structured set of activities to ensure that the software system meets the actual needs of users and stakeholders. Below are the five key activities involved:

- **üîç Requirement Gathering**
  - Collecting high-level requirements from stakeholders, clients, and end-users.
  - Involves surveys, interviews, brainstorming, and studying existing systems or documentation.

- **üó£Ô∏è Requirement Elicitation**
  - Actively engaging with stakeholders to uncover their needs‚Äîboth stated and unstated.
  - Techniques include workshops, use case development, questionnaires, observations, and prototyping.

- **üìù Requirement Documentation**
  - Recording the gathered and elicited requirements in a structured format.
  - Produces documents like Software Requirements Specification (SRS), use cases, or user stories.

- **üìä Requirement Analysis and Modeling**
  - Refining and analyzing the documented requirements to remove ambiguity, conflicts, or redundancy.
  - May involve creating models such as data flow diagrams (DFDs), entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs), or UML diagrams to visualize the system.

- **‚úÖ Requirement Validation**
  - Ensuring the documented requirements are accurate, complete, and aligned with business goals.
  - Includes reviews, walkthroughs, and validation sessions with stakeholders to confirm their correctness before development begins.
 
    ## üìÇ Types of Requirements

In software development, requirements are generally classified into two main types: **Functional Requirements** and **Non-functional Requirements**. Both are essential to ensure that the system behaves correctly and meets user expectations.

### ‚úÖ Functional Requirements

**Definition:**  
Functional requirements describe the specific behaviors, functions, and features the system must perform. They define **what** the system should do.

**Examples for the Booking Management System:**
- Users should be able to search for available properties by location and date.
- The system should allow users to create, view, and cancel bookings.
- Hosts should be able to add, update, or delete property listings.
- The platform should calculate the total price for a booking based on the selected dates.
- Users should receive booking confirmation via email after payment.

### üõ°Ô∏è Non-functional Requirements

**Definition:**  
Non-functional requirements define the system‚Äôs **quality attributes**, such as performance, security, usability, and reliability. They describe **how** the system should behave.

**Examples for the Booking Management System:**
- The system should load the homepage within 2 seconds under normal traffic.
- User data and payment information must be encrypted and securely stored.
- The system should support up to 10,000 concurrent users without crashing.
- The platform should be accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.
- All text should meet accessibility contrast requirements (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance).

Understanding the difference between functional and non-functional requirements is critical for planning, designing, and validating a successful software system.
